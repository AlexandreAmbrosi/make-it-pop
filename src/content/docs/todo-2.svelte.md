In this guide, you will learn how to TODO. You will go through the process of TODO.

## Prerequisites

You'll need the following:

- [Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v18-release-announce) or later

## Create a new Astro application

Let’s get started by creating a new Astro project. Execute the following command:

```bash
npm create astro@latest my-app
```

`npm create astro` is the recommended way to scaffold an Astro project quickly.

When prompted, choose:

- `Empty` when prompted on how to start the new project.
- `Yes` when prompted if plan to write Typescript.
- `Strict` when prompted how strict Typescript should be.
- `Yes` when prompted to install dependencies.
- `Yes` when prompted to initialize a git repository.

Once that’s done, you can move into the project directory and start the app:

```bash
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

The app should be running on [localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321/).

## Conclusion

In this guide, you learned how to TODO.
